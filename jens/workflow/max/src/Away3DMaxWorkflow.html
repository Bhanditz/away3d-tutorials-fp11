    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>For the launch of Away3d 4.0 Gold, we have prepared a series of tutorials that show the workflow from various 3D
        applications to Away3D and the Flash Player. This tutorial shows how to take a biped-animated model from
        Autodesk 3ds Max and turn it into an interactive Flash file as in the example below.</p>

    <p>Make sure you have 3ds Max installed and working on your computer. Then download the latest official version
        of Away3D 4 from the <a href="http://away3d.com/download/">Downloads section on Away3D.com</a> or grab the
        most current version <a href="http://github.com/away3d/">via GitHub</a> (If you don&#39;t know what GitHub
        is, just use the Download section). You will also need a tool for creating your Flash file such as
        Adobe Flash Builder (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html">download trial here</a>).</p>

    <h3>Adding the AWD plugin</h3>
    <p>The AWD format was created by the Away3D team to solve the headache of normal 3D file formats not being suited
        for the web. The goal is to create an extensible, compact format that allows the export 3D data with (or
        without) all assets embedded such as textures, animation and more. Any number of models is supported, so even
        complete scenes can be exported. The format is free, defined in an open specification, and has an open-source <a
            href="http://code.google.com/p/awd/source/checkout">SDK</a> for C++ and Python to aid in encoding AWD files.
        This is to encourage others to adopt it in their software as well. </p>
    <p>The AWD team aims to build AWD exporters for the most popular 3D packages such as Blender, Maya and 3ds Max. The
        3ds Max plugin for Max 2012 is available in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/awd/downloads/list">downloads
        section</a>. At the time this tutorial is written, the plugins for Maya and Blender plugins are only available
        as source code, but expect them to be available in compiled versions soon. </p>
    <p>To install the 3ds Max plugin, download the version that fits your system (32/64bit) and simply <a
            href="http://code.google.com/p/awd/wiki/3dsMax">follow the instructions here</a>. Once you have copied the
        files to the correct folder, restart Max to see the AWD option when you select Export from the main menu. </p>
    <a href="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/lo00_awd.png"
            rel="shadowbox[slideshow];options={counterType:'skip',continuous:true,animSequence:'sync'}"><img
            class="staticFigure" alt="" src="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/lo00_awd.png"
            style="width: 540px; height: 163px; "/></a>

<section>
    <h3>Preparing the model in Max</h3>
    <p>The model and code for this tutorial was created by French designer <a href="http://3dflashlo.wordpress.com">Thillet
        Laurent</a>. It started as a custom model that was rigged in Character Studio and animated with Biped. You can
        <a href="http://away3d.com/examples/away3d_4_0/MaxAWDWorkflow/MaxAWDWorkflow.zip">download the example files
            here</a>. This ZIP archive contains the 3ds Max file, textures, Biped .bip files, a src folder containing
        the actionscript code as well as a file called 'sequence.txt' that we&#39;ll get back to later. </p>
    <p>Opening the file 'onkba.max' in Max, you may get some dialogues as you open the file. Just click
        through these to open the file. Now you can use the scrub bar at the bottom of the screen to see the three
        animations showing the model in paused, walking and running states. If you open Graph Editors -&gt; Motion
        Mixer, you can see the three Biped animations and how they are ordered. From this screen, you can speed up/slow
        down each animation by extending/compressing it and also change order and position on the timeline.</p>
    <p><a href="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/lo01c.png"
                rel="shadowbox[slideshow];options={counterType:'skip',continuous:true,animSequence:'sync'}"><img
                class="staticFigure" alt="" src="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/lo01c.png"
                style="width: 540px; height: 339px; "/></a></p>
    <p>To view the Bones driving the animation, Open the Manage Layers panel. Turn off the bulb for the Hide-column on
        the BONE layer and turn it on for the SKIN layer. This skeleton will also be exported in the AWD file, but you
        can turn it off using Actionscript when playing it back. An option to only include layers set as 'renderable'
        is on the current wish-list that will solve this in the future.</p>
    <p><a href="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/lo01b.png"
                rel="shadowbox[slideshow];options={counterType:'skip',continuous:true,animSequence:'sync'}"><img
                class="staticFigure" alt="" src="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/lo01b.png"
                style="width: 540px; height: 324px; "/></a></p>
    <p>While you are working with your own files for AWD export, keep in mind that AWD currently supports geometry and
        meshes (including instancing), scene graph with containers and parenting, basic color and texture materials,
        skeletons and skeletal animation. Anything other than this such as procedural textures and other Max specific
        features will be ignored.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Exporting from Max</h3>
    <p>Once you have finished your model, we need to set up what parts of the animation we want to export. Start by
        creating a new folder that we can place our files in. Open a new Notepad-file and save it as 'sequences.txt'
        in the newly created folder. This file couples the animated frames with names that we can later reference in our
        code. You can find full instructions on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/awd/wiki/UsingSequencesTxtFiles">this
        Wiki page</a>.</p>
    <p>For our example file, we&#39;ll use the following content:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">Breathe 0 60&#10;Walk 70 130&#10;Run 140 157</pre></div>
    <p>This file is only used when exporting from Max, as the exporter embeds this data into the AWD file. You can
        change the sequence around and the first one mentioned will be played back by the AWD preview application that
        is included with the exporter plug-in. Now we are ready to export. Select Export from the main menu and browse
        to the correct folder. Choose AWD in the dropdown and input a file name. Once you click through, you&#39;ll get
        to the AWD export settings dialogue. click through the various headings to inspect the options available. For
        most purposes, the defaults are fine. Make sure that the name of the text file you just created is correct and
        click on the 'Flash Viewer' heading.</p>
    <p>After exporting the file, the exporter will by default create and open a Flash preview file. If you just want to
        view the file on your computer make sure 'Export for local preview' is checked. If you want to export
        the file for others to view online, check the 'Export for deployment' option. If you choose the
        latter, you will not see anything when opening the exported file locally. This is expected behavior and part of
        the Flash Player security sandbox model.</p>
    <p>Note that the plugin will export the whole scene. Exporting only selections is currently not supported. In our
        case, we&#39;ll want to view the exported file so check the 'Export for local preview'-option. The
        resulting file will look like this:</p>
    <p><a href="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/Screen_shot_2012-07-04_at_3.40.34_PM.png"
                rel="shadowbox[slideshow];options={counterType:'skip',continuous:true,animSequence:'sync'}"><img
                class="staticFigure" alt=""
                src="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/Screen_shot_2012-07-04_at_3.40.34_PM.png"
                style="width: 541px; height: 308px; "/></a></p>
    <p>Don&#39;t worry if the Skeleton shows in the exported file. When you use it in Flash, it&#39;s up to you to make
        it visible. In other words - just ignore it and it won&#39;t be shown.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px; "><em>Troubleshooting: if the exported file just shows a blank window and nothing loads, it is very probable that
            something is wrong with your 'sequences.txt'-file. Double-check that the file is inside the folder
            you are exporting to, that the filename is correct and that the contents of the file match your file. See
            the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/awd/wiki/UsingSequencesTxtFiles">Wiki page</a> for instructions.</em></p>

    <h3>Using the model in Flash</h3>
    <p>This tutorial will not focus on the basic setup of an Away3D 4 scene, but check out the <a
            href="http://away3d.com/tutorials/">Tutorials section</a> for tutorials teaching the basics of cameras,
        lights, materials and adding objects to your scene. In this tutorial, we&#39;ll be concentrating on the steps
        that make it possible to load the exported AWD file and then how to access and control the animations within.</p>
    <p>For the Flash part of this tutorial, we&#39;ll use the Adobe product Flash Builder (<a
            href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html">download 30-day trial version here</a>), but you can
        of course use any other IDEs as well. You can find a detailed description on how use Away3D with Adobe Flash,
        Flash Builder and the free Open Source tool FlashDevelop <a
            href="http://www.flashmagazine.com/tutorials/detail/installing_away3d_for_flash_flex_or_flashdevelop/">here</a>.
        You may also be interested in <a
            href="http://www.flashmagazine.com/tutorials/detail/using_actionscript_projects_in_flex_or_flash/">this
        tutorial</a> that explains how to use Actionscript projects in these same tools. </p>
    <p>Start by creating a New -&gt; Actionscript Project. Name the project 'MaxAWDWorkflow' and press
        ok.</p>
    <p><a href="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/Screen_shot_fdsfsfdsfds.png"
                rel="shadowbox[slideshow];options={counterType:'skip',continuous:true,animSequence:'sync'}"><img
                class="staticFigure" alt="" src="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/Screen_shot_fdsfsfdsfds.png"
                style="width: 540px; height: 600px; "/></a></p>
    <p>Copy all the example files for this tutorial (link) into the newly created project folder. This will replace the
        empty actionscript file named 'MaxAWDWorkflow.as' that your IDE created for you. We&#39;ll use this
        very soon, but first we need to tell Flash Builder where to find the Away3D source files.</p>
    <p>You can download the source files either as a ZIP archive (link) from Github as mentioned above. Once you have
        copied these files to a suitable folder on your computer, you right click your project root and click 'Properties'
        in the popup menu. Click the 'Actionscript Build Path' in the dialogue that opens, then on the 'Source
        Path' button  and click the 'Add Folder' button. Select the folder containing the
        Away3D source files and close the dialogues.</p>
    <p><a href="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/Away_adding_away.png"
                rel="shadowbox[slideshow];options={counterType:'skip',continuous:true,animSequence:'sync'}"><img
                class="staticFigure" alt="" src="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/Away_adding_away.png"
                style="width: 540px; height: 520px; "/></a></p>
    <p>Your Project Explorer should now have the following files and folders and the MaxAWDWorkflow.as file should now
        contain the following:</p>
    <p><a href="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/Screen_shot_2012-07-08_at_4.56.19_PM.png"
                rel="shadowbox[slideshow];options={counterType:'skip',continuous:true,animSequence:'sync'}"><img
                class="staticFigure" alt=""
                src="http://away3d.com/images/uploads/Screen_shot_2012-07-08_at_4.56.19_PM.png"
                style="width: 540px; height: 294px; "/></a></p>
    <p>Click the green 'Run' button at the top and verify that you can see a round, red sphere. If you
        can&#39;t see anything in the exported file or you get a 'Error #2044' message, you may need to add a
        little extra code to your HTML template. This is explained in the section below. If you see the red sphere,
        skip ahead to the next heading.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Stage3D embedding</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, you can&#39;t just export your file when working with Stage3D. The most common problem is that
        you get a dialogue that says 'Error #2044: Unhandled ErrorEvent:. text=Error #3702: Context3D not
        available.' Context3D is one of the core classes for Stage3D in the Flash Player. Using Stage3D requires
        that you set the following parameter in your HTML embed code:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">params.wmode='direct';</pre></div>
    <p>Click to expand the image below and you can see the required addition in context.</p>
    <p><a href="http://away3d.com/images/carousel/awd_max_html_wrapper.png"
                rel="shadowbox[slideshow];options={counterType:'skip',continuous:true,animSequence:'sync'}"><img
                class="staticFigure" alt="" src="http://away3d.com/images/carousel/awd_max_html_wrapper.png"
                style="width: 540px; height: 211px; "/></a></p>
    <p>If you are using Adobe AIR, you may need to add:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">&lt;renderMode&gt;direct&lt;/renderMode&gt;</pre></div>
    <p>into your application.xml. If you still have problems, note that if you are using Flash Builder, IntelliJ or
        FlashDevelop or any IDE based on an older version of the Flex SDK, you will need to add the following compiler
        argument:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">-swf-version=13</pre></div>
    <p>This will force compilation for Flash Player 11.x.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Running the example file</h3>
    <p>Once you know this works as intended, it is time to test the exported .awd file. To do this, set the 'AWDViewerLoth.as'
        file to be the file to run.</p>
    <p>How to do this varies by IDE, but in Adobe Flash Builder, you just right click the 'AWDViewerLoth.as'-file
        and select 'Set as Default application'. Just keep the 'AWDViewerLoth.as' open for the rest
        of this tutorial as we&#39;ll be referencing bits of it later on. Press the green Run button again and if all
        goes as intended, you&#39;ll soon see our animated friend. You can use the WASD keys to rotate and walk around.
        Hold down the Shift key to run.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px; "><em>If the file fails to run and you get the message 'SecurityError: Error #2148', you&#39;ll need to
            add the compiler argument </em><em>-use-network=false to your setup. </em><em>Please <a
            href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/304271/security-sandbox-in-as3">read this entry on Stack
        Overflow</a> for how to solve this.</em></p>
    <p>So what makes this model work? I&#39;ll walk you through the code next. The constructor-method contains calls to
        the methods initEngine, initText and initLights. These set up the scene, view and camera, all the basics that we
        need to view our 3D content. The last method called in the constructor is called initLoading and this is where
        we load our assets using the AssetLibrary class.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>The AssetLibrary</h3>
    <p>This is a new class in Away3D 4 and it really simplifies working with loaded assets. Assets are any item that
        can be used in the engine: a Mesh, a Geometry, a BitmapTexture etc. You basically just tell the AssetLibrary to
        load what you need (models, textures, animations) and then request the results when loaded. </p>
    <p>The first thing you must do is to enable the file format parsers that you want to use in your project. Away3D4
        can import files in the formats OBJ, AC3D, DAE, 3DS, MD2, MD5 as well as the native AWD1 and 2 formats. If you
        are lazy, you can add all these parsers in one go:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">Parsers.enableAllBundled();</pre></div>
    <p>However, the more parsers you enable, the larger your swf-file. In our project, we&#39;re saving 82Kb by
        enabling the AWD2 parser only:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">AssetLibrary.enableParser( AWD2Parser );</pre></div>
    <p>The AssetLibrary will keep you updated on the loading progress. This is done using the Event-listener system
        built into Flash:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">AssetLibrary.addEventListener( AssetEvent.ASSET_COMPLETE, onAssetComplete );&#10;AssetLibrary.addEventListener( LoaderEvent.RESOURCE_COMPLETE, onResourceComplete );&#10;AssetLibrary.addEventListener( LoaderEvent.LOAD_ERROR, onLoadError );</pre></div>
    <p>The code above lets us listen for three important things:</p>
    <p><strong>AssetEvent.ASSET_COMPLETE</strong><br/> A 3D model may require more than just the mesh. In our case, the
        model contains animations that are controlled by a skeleton. The skeleton has different poses and it may also
        embed materials (basic color-materials and textures are supported). The model itself is built from many
        different sub-meshes and these contain geometry. Using the onAssetComplete-method you can inspect at all of
        these as they load in and apply actions to them. </p>
    <p>In this tutorial, we only use this event for debugging as the loading itself is handled by the AssetLibrary. By
        using a trace-command, we can see the name and type of each asset as it is loaded in. As you can see, the loaded
        assets all have the same names we used when authoring in 3ds Max and the animations map to the names we added to
        the 'sequencences.txt' file. If there is a naming conflict, the AssetLibrary has ways of handling this
        too. Taking care when naming your models, will save you any problems with this.</p>
    <p>You can also listen for even more granulated events that tell when each of these assets has been loaded. You can
        look up these events by looking at the top of the AssetLibraryBundle-class included in the Away3D source.</p>
    <p><strong>LoaderEvent.LOAD_ERROR</strong><br/> In the event of something not loading as it should, we have to
        handle this in some way. In this tutorial, we are just tracing the error out to the console, but for a larger
        project it will be helpful to show the user an error message. </p>
    <p>If you do not add a handler for this event, your project will simply not display anything. No error will be
        displayed to the user unless they have the special Debug version of the Flash Player installed. This is only
        common among Flash developers, so you should be able to see 'Error #2032: Stream Error' in your
        IDE if this happens. Normal users will just see a blank screen, so make sure you handle this event by adding
        this EventListener to your loader.</p>
    <p><strong>LoaderEvent.RESOURCE_COMPLETE</strong><br/> For every element you request that the AssetLibrary should
        load, this event will fire. In our case, the texture is separate from the AWD model so we have two load calls:
    </p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">AssetLibrary.load( new URLRequest( TEXTURE_URL ) );&#10;AssetLibrary.load( new URLRequest( MESH_URL ) );</pre></div>
    <p>Note that AWD2 may also embed the textures into the model. This simplifies asset management at the price of
        larger files.</p>
    <p>On the web, there is no guarantee that assets will complete loading in the same order as we request them. To
        manage this, the onResourceComplete-method maintains a counter to check that we have loaded all the resources we
        need before moving on. Once both the model and the texture has loaded, it is safe to display our 3D model. This
        is done in the setupScene-method.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3>Rendering the output</h3>
    <p>Anything that is to be rendered in Away3D must be added to 'the scene'. Some parts such as the 'ground'
        was added in the initEngine-method. In the setupScene-method we prepare the material for our 'hero'
        and then apply it to the model. The model is also scaled. Since most 3D programs work in arbitrary 'units',
        scaling your model will often be required.</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">hero.scale( 8 );</pre></div>
    <p>This is easy to avoid if you just know how the camera-setup will work. You can of course also tweak the camera
        setup to compensate for model size. It&#39;s all relative, so you decide. For larger 3D projects it is important
        to avoid any such issues by agreeing on a 'world scale' and then making sure all models follow
        that.</p>
    <p>When the model is set up as we want it, we add it to our scene:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">scene.addChild( hero );</pre></div>
    <p>This makes the model renderable and thus visible. It&#39;ll be standing in the default pose so, next up we set
        up the animation set. This acts a container for animation data and use the values we captured in the
        ASSET_COMPLETE handler earlier:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">animationSet = new SkeletonAnimationSet(3);&#10;animationSet.addState(breatheState.name, breatheState);&#10;animationSet.addState(walkState.name, walkState);&#10;animationSet.addState(runState.name, runState);</pre></div>
    <p>Now that we have our animation set,  we set up our animator that will connect the animation data to the
        model, and provide a control mechanism. We do this with an animator object that ties together the skeleton we
        retrieved from ASSET_COMPLETE along with the newly created animation set, and applies it to our hero model. In
        order to stop the character from walking away from the camera, we disable the position update that usually
        applies to bones animation when any motion is expected</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">animator = new SkeletonAnimatior(animationSet, skeleton);&#10;animator.updateRootPosition = false;&#10;hero.animator = animator;</pre></div>
    <p>Finally, we define a state transition for our animation states. This is used when transitioning active states in
        the animator, and can be custom created for whatever behavior is required. For now, we will use the default
        crossfade transition object:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">crossfadeTransition = new CrossfadeStateTransition(XFade_TIME);</pre></div>
    <p>XFADE_TIME is a constant (defined at the top of the Actionscript file) that tells how many seconds Away3D should
        blend between the current and the new animation state. Setting this to zero would cause the change to happen
        instantly. This looks bad, so you usually want to blend the vertex positions as we do here.</p>
    <p>To be sure that all the animations were successfully loaded and created, we test that animationSet.hasState for
        each animation exists. This isn&#39;t required, but it&#39;s a good idea to do this to avoid strange errors. If
        all is good, we point the camera at our hero and start rendering and listening for user input.</p>
    <p>Depending on what key the user presses, the movement of the character is done in the updateMovement-method. If
        the user is not pressing any key, the goToPauseState method is executed. In both of these, we set the name of
        the animation state and then activate it using:</p>
    <div class="preBox"><pre class="brush: as3">animator.play(currentAnim, crossfadeTransition);</pre></div>

    <h3>Summing up</h3>
    <p>Thanks to the AWD format and the AWD plugins, it is easy to import animated and textured models straight from
        Autodesk 3ds Max into Away3D. The new AssetLibrary in Away3D 4 simplifies the loading procedure for anything
        ranging from basic scenes like this, to large and complex games. The Actionscript language makes it easy to
        build large scale interactive applications for the web and mobile and the compact AWD files improve the end user
        experience by ensuring less loading time.</p>
